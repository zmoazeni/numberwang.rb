## What is this? ##
This is a sample repository used in a [blog post about single-assertions-per-test vs one-focus-per-test](http://connectionrequired.com/blog/2014/12/a-hypothesis-about-the-number-of-assertions-per-test/).

Instead of using a trivial example or putting together a fake context, I created a [Numberwang!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjOZtWZ56lc) service.

## To run: ##

    bundle install
    bundle exec rspec numberwang_service_spec.rb
